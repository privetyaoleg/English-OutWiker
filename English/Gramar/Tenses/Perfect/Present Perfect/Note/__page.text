!!!! 1) Remember the adverbials with "for" can be used with different tenses:
* He has lived in California for a month (hi is still there now)
* He sleeps for nine hours every night (a daily routine)
* She was in hospital for a month (she is no longer there)
* She is staying to her mother for a week (she will leave in a week)

!!!! 2) Observer the difference in the meaning of a question with "How long" depending on the tense-form:
* How long have you been here for? (Since when?) с какого момента
* How long are you here for? (Until when?) до какого момента
* How long were you there? (A fact in the past) в прошлом - уже не ждет
